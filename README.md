My python work.

Well I'm just a student who is trying to learn python, in this repository I will upload my work and some projects I'm doing. Please if you use, give credit, thank you!  

Pd. Just to clarify I'm student, I'm still learning, don't expect my code to be perfect, but I can asure you that everything that I upload works. In case there is any problem in my code I will tell you!
